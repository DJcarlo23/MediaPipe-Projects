# MediaPipe-Projects

This is my attempt to work with MediaPipe library. Each folder contains code that demonstrates the capabilities of this library and mini projects in which I used it. <p>
<b>FaceDetection</b> - simple face detection which detect face and mark it on the image with frame. <br>
<b>FaceMesh</b> - main idea is to estimate 463 landmarks on the face of the person so that you can use it in other programs. <br>
<b>HandsTracking</b> - a lot like FaceMesh but in this case we have only 20 landmarks which represents hand. <br>
<b>PoseEstimation</b> - estimate pose of the person with 33 landmarks
